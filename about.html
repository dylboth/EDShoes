      EDSHOES is not just a shoe company; it is a way of life. Therefore, knowing more about the EDSHOES culture will greatly enhance your experience with these shoes.<br><br>
      Founded in 2022, EDSHOES is on a mission to transform the way people view shoes. Throughout history, mankind has been creating shoes with bottoms. To Ethan and Dylan, the founders of EDSHOES, this is unnaceptable! Shoes should only have the top part because then the bottom part is left open.<br><br>
      The EDSHOES culture is comprised of individuals who are making a real difference in the world by uncovering the bottoms of their feet. It is truly a culture that empowers people to wear shoes on their feet, not under their feet. It is easy to know when you belong to the EDSHOE culture because the bottoms of your feet are uncovered like the rest of the EDSHOE wearers.<br><br>
      Despite being less than a year old, EDSHOES anticipates being the world's leading shoe company. They already have a monopoly in the bottom-less shoe market, foreshadowing a domination of the shoe market as a whole.<br><br>

          Dylan Cobbler has never lost; hence the nickname 'undefeated.' Aside from being a world-leading expert in bottom-less footwear, Dylan is a ninja, turbocharged astronaut, and philosopher. He has a plethura of elite skills and techniques that allow him to dominate always. Dylan's passion for having things on the top of your feet instead of the bottom led him to start the first ever bottom-less shoe company with his brother Ethan.

          Since it's always 'everyday buckets' with Ethan Cobbler, he has accurately been given the nickname 'buckets.' Before co-founding EDSHOES, Ethan pioneered the fire-lazer industry. He also likes to dabble in space fishing and strength-turtle wrestling. Like his brother Dylan, Ethan has a passion for covering the top of our feet, but not the bottom.
