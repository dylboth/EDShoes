      Want to know what sets EDSHOES apart from other shoes? You're in the right place!<br><br>
      The thing that really seperates EDSHOES from other shoes is the fact that our shoes are completely exposed on the bottoms. You might be asking yourself, "shouldn't shoes cover the bottoms of our feet?" To this question, we passionately respond, "No way, silly goose!" because we know that shoes should not include the bottom part. Don't just take our word for it though. Take a look at these images to see the difference for yourself.<br><br>
      Here is an ordinary shoe:<br><br>

      <br><br>And here is one of our shoes:<br>
